# What is the AI on Demand Platform?

The AI on Demand platform is a collection of AI services. Originally created by
the AI4EU project, it is currently managed by the AI4Europe project. Currently,
there are two main services available: the content management system allows
publishing organisations, assets, projects, events, institutions, case studies,
open calls, and research bundles. The experiments platform allows the assembly
of experiments from components with Protobuf interfaces.

The content management system will soon be replaced by a service-based system,
which will make it easier to add additional services. The EuroCore will heavily
rely on the services provided already on the AI on Demand platform and add new
services to satisfy robotics related requirements. Any content added to the
content management system today will be migrated to the new system by the
AI4Europe project. 

# Guide

If your organisation is not yet on the platform, this is a good point to
start. Adding assets requires an organisation for the “Developed by” field on
the platform.  You can find a video tutorial on the platform (here).

1. Visit: https://www.ai4europe.eu/contribute
2. Log-in with ECAS (no dedicated account required)
3. Choose the type of contribution
  - For our purpose, we can treat “AI Asset” simply as “Asset”
  - If you have a contribution that does not fit anywhere, skip to step 8 and let us know about it
4. Add required Information
  - Select **EuroCore (1610)** under keywords
  - For assets, make sure to include a link to the actual asset (e.g., a git repository link)
  - Summary: one or two sentence summary
  - Main characteristic: abstract-like description
  - Detailed description: additional details, how to use, requirements, references to papers
  - If no category fits for a given field you should be able to leave it blank
5. Save (nothing will be published yet)
  - If the save is successful, the asset will open as it would appear to someone visiting the platform
6. Review your asset
7. Submit to review
  - Enter your profile page (in the top right, see Figure below)
  - You will see your asset in Draft status
  - Edit the asset and make any desired changes
  - Once you are happy with the quality, change the status to “Submitted to Review” and save once more (see second figure below)
8. Let us know
  - Visit: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DQdYLi26VxFtUPkhHefs86hOPJrXyGkIwg6gwhXM_m0/edit
  - Let us know about your asset so we can link it to the euROBIN project
  - Add any feedback on the process, missing features, ideas, etc.
