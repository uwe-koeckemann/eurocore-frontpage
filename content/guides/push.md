# How to Push to the EuroCore Community (Zenodo)

## Best Practices

- Link your records
  - Allow discovery of previous works and projects
  - Tell a story of how your work evolved
- Add keywords to make your records easier to discover
- Add enough information to data sets and software to allow others to easily use it
  - What is the shortest path from discovering your work to putting it to use?

## What to Push

- All software/data/model/... that should be pulled as part of open call
  - Reference related papers, tutorials, etc.
- All results presented in project reviews
- All euROBIN events (Coopetition, workshops, ...)

## Join the Community

- Sign-up to Zenodo or join with existing Github, Orcid or OpenAIRE account
- Go to https://zenodo.org/communities/eurocore/

## Push Existing Record (< 1min)

You can submit existing assets to the EuroCore community on Zenodo. 

https://help.zenodo.org/docs/share/submit-to-community/

1. Open your existing record on Zenodo
2. Find the *Communities* entry on the right and clock the wheel icon. 
3. Select *Submit to community*
4. Search for *EuroCore*

## Create New Record (5-10mins)

- Visit: https://zenodo.org/communities/eurocore/records
- Click: *New upload*
- Select resource type
  - ROS nodes or similar should go under "Software"
  - Maps and robot models under "Model"
  - Robots under "Physical Object"
  - Coopetition, competitions, workshops under "Event"
- Select keywords
  - Upper-case first letters for most words, except:
    - Acronyms always properly cased (e.g., RGB)
    - Conjunctions, articles, short propositions are lower case (a, an, the, by,
      with, and, or) unless they are first letter or the keyword
  - Examples: https://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/ra-l/keywords
- Fill out remaining meta-data
- Add references to any related works (papers, data, models)
- Add file(s) to upload
- Publish when ready

## Update a Record

- You can update meta-data of records at any time

## Review Policy

- All members of euROBIN will be added as "Curator"
  - Curators, managers, and owners can publish without review
- External members will be added as "Reader" 
  - Reader records require review by Curator

# How to Push the the AI on Demand Community Portal

The AI on Demand platform is a collection of AI services. Originally created by
the AI4EU project, it is currently managed by the AI4Europe project. Currently,
there are two main services available: the content management system allows
publishing organisations, assets, projects, events, institutions, case studies,
open calls, and research bundles. The experiments platform allows the assembly
of experiments from components with Protobuf interfaces.

The content management system will soon be replaced by a service-based system,
which will make it easier to add additional services. The EuroCore will heavily
rely on the services provided already on the AI on Demand platform and add new
services to satisfy robotics related requirements. Any content added to the
content management system today will be migrated to the new system by the
AI4Europe project. 

## Guide

If your organisation is not yet on the platform, this is a good point to
start. Adding assets requires an organisation for the “Developed by” field on
the platform.  You can find a video tutorial on the platform (here).

1. Visit: https://www.ai4europe.eu/contribute
2. Log-in with ECAS (no dedicated account required)
3. Choose the type of contribution
  - For our purpose, we can treat “AI Asset” simply as “Asset”
  - If you have a contribution that does not fit anywhere, skip to step 8 and let us know about it
4. Add required Information
  - Select **EuroCore (1610)** under keywords
  - For assets, make sure to include a link to the actual asset (e.g., a git repository link)
  - Summary: one or two sentence summary
  - Main characteristic: abstract-like description
  - Detailed description: additional details, how to use, requirements, references to papers
  - If no category fits for a given field you should be able to leave it blank
5. Save (nothing will be published yet)
  - If the save is successful, the asset will open as it would appear to someone visiting the platform
6. Review your asset
7. Submit to review
  - Enter your profile page (in the top right, see Figure below)
  - You will see your asset in Draft status
  - Edit the asset and make any desired changes
  - Once you are happy with the quality, change the status to “Submitted to Review” and save once more (see second figure below)
8. Let us know
  - Visit: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DQdYLi26VxFtUPkhHefs86hOPJrXyGkIwg6gwhXM_m0/edit
  - Let us know about your asset so we can link it to the euROBIN project
  - Add any feedback on the process, missing features, ideas, etc.
